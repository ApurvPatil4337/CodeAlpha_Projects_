1.Network Sniffer: Objective: This tool captures and analyzes network traffic to monitor data packets moving through the network. It helps in identifying potential vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or unusual activities, which could indicate security risks. Focus Areas: Learning how to capture network traffic using tools like Wireshark or tcpdump, analyzing protocols, and identifying malicious traffic.

2.Phishing Awareness Presentation: Objective: Creating an informative presentation to educate users about phishing attacks. The presentation will cover types of phishing, how to recognize phishing emails or websites, and best practices for avoiding such attacks. Focus Areas: Research on phishing techniques, designing user-friendly slides, and presenting effective security awareness training.

3.Secure Coding Review: Objective: Reviewing source code to identify security flaws and vulnerabilities in the codebase. This might involve inspecting the code for SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other common vulnerabilities. Focus Areas: Best practices in secure coding, common vulnerabilities (e.g., OWASP Top 10), and how to mitigate them. You will likely use tools like static code analyzers and manual inspection to find security flaws.

4.Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS): Objective: Designing or implementing an intrusion detection system that monitors network traffic for suspicious activities and alerts administrators. The system can be signature-based or anomaly-based. Focus Areas: Learning about intrusion detection techniques, configuring IDS systems
